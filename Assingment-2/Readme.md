1. EvenOddArray.java
Description:
This Java program separates even and odd numbers entered by the user into two separate arrays named 'even' and 'odd'. It prompts the user to input the number of elements they want to enter and then prompts for each element. After the user enters all elements, the program divides them into two arrays based on whether they are even or odd and then prints the contents of each array.

2. NearestNeighbours.java
Description:
This Java program implements a method findNearest() to find two neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance between them. The program allows the user to input an array of integers and then finds and prints the index of the first number in the array with the smallest distance to its neighbor. If the array is empty or contains less than two elements, it throws an IllegalArgumentException.

3. ArrayArrayListConversion.java
Description:
This Java program demonstrates how to convert an array into an ArrayList and vice versa. It contains two methods: one to convert an array to an ArrayList and another to convert an ArrayList to an array. The program initializes an array and an ArrayList, performs the conversion operations, and then prints the converted arrays to demonstrate the conversion process.

These descriptions provide an overview of what each program does and what functionality it offers. They can be included in the README file on GitHub to provide users with information about the purpose and usage of each program.
