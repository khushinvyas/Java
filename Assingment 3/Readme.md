**Student Management System**

**Overview**

This Java program implements a simple menu-driven Student Management System. It allows users to perform various operations on a collection of student records, such as adding students, displaying all students, searching for students by PRN or name, updating student details, and deleting students.

**Features**

Add Student:
Allows users to add a new student to the system by providing details such as PRN (Permanent Registration Number), name, date of birth, and marks.
Display All Students: Displays all students currently stored in the system along with their details.
Search by PRN:
Allows users to search for a student by their PRN and displays their details if found.
Search by Name: 
Allows users to search for a student by their name (case-insensitive) and displays their details if found.
Update Student Details: 
Allows users to update the details of a student by specifying their PRN. Users can update the student's name, date of birth, and marks.
Delete Student: 
Allows users to delete a student from the system by specifying their PRN.

Usage

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Compile the Java source files using any Java compiler.
Run the Main class file to start the program.
Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various operations on the student records.
Input Validation
The program expects the PRN to be an integer value. If a non-integer value is entered, an error will occur.
The program does not currently handle invalid input formats for other fields (name, date of birth, marks). It assumes valid input formats are provided.
Future Improvements
Implement input validation for other fields (name, date of birth, marks) to ensure data integrity.
Improve error handling and provide more informative error messages to users.
Implement file I/O functionality to store student records persistently.
